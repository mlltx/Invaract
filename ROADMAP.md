# Invariant Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Establish the Project Foundations

### Objective

Create a credible open-source project before implementing substantial functionality.

The goal of Phase 0 is to establish the organizational, legal, and technical infrastructure required to accept external contributions without requiring architectural restructuring later.

### Next Phase

**Phase 1 — Core Verification Engine** (follow this document)

Once Phase 0 is complete, implementation work can proceed with confidence that the project structure supports external contributions and future evolution.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Verification Engine

### Phase 1a — Contract Model

#### Objective

Represent the minimum contract required to verify a transformation while
remaining compatible with an established open contract standard.

ODCS (Open Data Contract Standard) was evaluated as the base representation.
Invariant avoids redefining concepts ODCS already standardizes (schema,
fields, types) and folds anything else it doesn't yet interpret into
`extensions` rather than rejecting it. See
[docs/CONTRACT_MODEL.md](docs/CONTRACT_MODEL.md) for the full design.

```yaml
id: customer_orders
version: 1.0

inputs:
  - location: raw.orders
    schema:
      ...

outputs:
  - location: gold.customer_orders
    schema:
      ...

rules:
  ...
```

#### Requirements

The model supports:

- [x] Contract identity
- [x] Version
- [x] Input datasets
- [x] Output datasets
- [x] Physical locations
- [x] Schemas
- [x] Field names
- [x] Types
- [x] Nullability
- [x] Required/optional semantics
- [x] Compatibility rules
- [x] Contract extensions

#### Deliverables

- [x] **Contract parser** — `ContractParser` (YAML → object model), fail-fast on structural errors (`contract/src/main/scala/com/example/contract/ContractParser.scala`)
- [x] **Contract object model** — `Contract`, `Dataset`, `Schema`, `Field`, `ContractVersion`, `ContractRule` (`contract/src/main/scala/com/example/contract/ContractModel.scala`)
- [x] **Contract validation** — `ContractValidator`, structural checks beyond parseability: duplicate names, empty schemas, contradictory flags, unknown types (`contract/src/main/scala/com/example/contract/ContractValidator.scala`)
- [x] **Versioning semantics** — `ContractCompatibility`, diffs two contract versions and classifies the required MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH bump (`contract/src/main/scala/com/example/contract/ContractCompatibility.scala`)
- [x] **Contract fixtures** — valid, additive, breaking, and invalid example contracts (`contract/src/test/resources/fixtures/`)
- [x] **Documentation** — [docs/CONTRACT_MODEL.md](docs/CONTRACT_MODEL.md)

31 unit tests across parser, validator, and compatibility engine, run via `cd contract && sbt test`.
